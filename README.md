# RandomMaze

This was a prject I started to test my recursion skills that I learned in College. I had not done recursion for almost 4 years when I started this project and used little to no help from the internet unless if I ran into syntax or unknoen errors. Overall I find that it works well and is relatively efficient. I am working on making the code more streamlined and readable and improving how the mazes look on the Command Line.

I hope you enjoy my project, Random Maze.
